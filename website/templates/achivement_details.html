            <h4>venue</h4>
            <p>The Olympic Stadium in Athens was selected as the venue for the 2007 UEFA Champions League final at the April 2005 meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Tallinn, Estonia.</p>
            <p>The meeting also determined the venues for the 2006 final and the 2006 and 2007 UEFA Cup finals.Shortly before the final, the UEFA Champions League trophy was returned to UEFA by Ludovic Giuly, representing the 2006 winners, Barcelona. UEFA president Michel Platini then presented the trophy to the Mayor of Athens, Nikitas Kaklamanis, so that it might be put on display in and around the city.</p>
            <h4>history</h4>
            <p>The match was Milan's eleventh appearance in the final, and the third since 2003. They had won on six occasions (1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003), and lost four times (1958, 1993, 1995, 2005). Liverpool were appearing in their seventh final.</p>
            <p>They had previously won the competition five times (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005), while they lost the 1985 final to Juventus. The final was a rematch of the 2005 final which Liverpool won 3–2 in a penalty shootout, after recovering from a three-goal deficit at half-time to level the score at 3–3 after full-time and extra time.</p>
            <h4>background</h4>
            <p>Liverpool gained entry to the competition after finishing third in the 2005–06 FA Premier League. As a result of that league position, Liverpool entered the Champions League in the third qualifying round, where their opponents were Maccabi Haifa of Israel.</p>
            <p>Liverpool won the first leg 2–1 at their home ground Anfield and a 1–1 draw in the away leg in Kyiv ensured Liverpool progressed to the group stage of the competition. Liverpool were drawn in Group C alongside French team Bordeaux, Dutch team PSV and Galatasaray of Turkey.</p>
